Physics based fighting game that started out personal and evolved into a school project.
All of the "art" assets were made by me in Adobe Illustrator.
This Project is currently still in Development, and will likely be finished soon!

Left Stick to Move
Right Stick to Aim your Attack

Right Trigger to Attack
